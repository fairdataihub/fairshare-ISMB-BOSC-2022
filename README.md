The abstract of our poster and presentation is copied here:

"We present here FAIRshare, an open-source and free (MIT license) cross-platform desktop software that helps biomedical researchers in making their research software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) in line with the FAIR for research software (FAIR4RS) guiding principles. The FAIR4RS principles, established by the FAIR4RS Working group, provide a foundation for optimizing the reusability of research software and encourage open science. The FAIR4RS principles are, however, aspirational. Practical guidelines that biomedical researchers can easily follow for making their research software FAIR are still lacking. To fill this gap, we established the first minimal and actionable step-by-step guidelines for researchers to make their biomedical research software FAIR. We designate these guidelines as the FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines. FAIRshare walks the users step-by-step into implementing the FAIR-BioRS guidelines for their research software (including metadata such as codemeta.json, choosing a license – preferably open source, sharing on a suitable repository such as Zenodo, etc.). The process is streamlined through an intuitive graphical user interface and automation such as to minimize researchers’ time and effort. We believe that the FAIR-BioRS guidelines and FAIRshare will empower and encourage biomedical researchers into adopting FAIR and open practices for their research software."
